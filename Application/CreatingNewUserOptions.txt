When creating new user options, there are many things to do:

1. Add the option to the UserOptions structure. Make the type the "real" type
   and not a registry type.
2. Create a registry key constant for the registry value and a default value
   if necessary.
3. Create a new method that gets and sets the new value.
4. Call the method in the Form_Load method.
5. Adjust any other code to use the new option variable rather than hard coded
   values. (Check this carefully!)
6. Add the option to the Options form.
7. Add the option initialisation to the Options form Form_Load method.
8. Save the settings in ValidateAndSaveChanges.
9. Back in Form_Main, MenuOptions, save the value and act upon it if necessary.
10. Add an explanation to the help files.
