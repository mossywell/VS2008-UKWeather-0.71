            Gets a URI and returns the response as a string. Note that:
            1. The caller must handle any exceptions, which generally occur when the
               request is being got and when the stream reader is reading the response.
            2. Keepalives are set to false.
            3. If a redirection took place (that is, the URI requested was not the one
               that was returned), an empty string is returned.
