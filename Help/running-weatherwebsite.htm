<h1>Weather Web Site</h1>
Selecting this option causes a <i>new</i> instance of the default browser to
connect to the web site that the data is obtained from:
http://uk.w3.weather.com/weather/local/ plus the current postcode that it is
configured to obtained data for (for example,
http://uk.w3.weather.com/weather/local/SW19).<br><br>
Note that:
<ul>
<li>I have made every effort to prevent UK Weather from "hijacking" existing
browser sessions (which unfortunately the .Net Framework makes very easy to
do).</li>
<li>Sometimes, www.weather.com change their URLs. If this happens, UK Weather
will stop working. See <a href="troubleshooting.htm">Troubleshooting</a>.</li>
<li>I do not believe that I'm breaking any laws by using the information from
their web site - I am after all simply re-parsing it and presenting it just as
any web browser does.</li>
</ul>
