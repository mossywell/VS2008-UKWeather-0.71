<h1>Colour Scheme</h1>
This screen shows the various colours used for the different system tray icons
(in both Celsius and Farenheit).
The colours are read only. (Sorry!) The left hand side of each pair shows the
"normal" colour which is displayed if the icon is not set to flash or change
colour, and also if the mouse has been moved over the icon. The right hand side
colour is the "flash" colour, which is shown if the options are set to
"Change the System Tray icon colour" or "Flash the System Tray icon".<br><br>
