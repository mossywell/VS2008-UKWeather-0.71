<h1>UK Weather Desktop</h1>
<h2>Desktop Icon</h2>
Once installed, the application will show as a shortcut icon on the desktop:
<br><br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img style="text-align: center;" src="images\desktop-icon.jpg">
</div><br><br>
Double-click on the icon to start it. Any settings from when UK Weather was last
run, such as the postcode, will automatically be loaded again. The default
values, which are used when UK Weather is run the first time, are as follows:
<br><br>
<table>
<tr>
<td class="bold">Check Version and URL</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="bold">When the weather changes</td>
<td>Flash the System Tray icon</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="bold">Icon Flash Frequency</td>
<td>500</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="bold">New Version Popup</td>
<td>Yes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="bold">Postcode</td>
<td>SW19</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="bold">Temperature Scale</td>
<td>Celsius</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="bold">Update Interval</td>
<td>300</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="bold">Run at Startup</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
</table><br><br>
<h2>System Tray Icon</h2>
Once running, UK Weather will appear as an icon in the system tray
(shown on the left in the following image):<br><br>
<div class="center">
<img src="images\tray-icons.jpg"></div><br><br>
Of course, your own icons will probably be different to this and the temperature
will probably be different. The icon shows the temperature in degrees Celsius
(centigrade). If the mouse is hovered over the icon, the popup will also show
the following information.<br>
<br>
<div class="center">
<img src="images\running-mouseover.png"></div><br><br>

<h2>System Tray Icon Symbols</h2>
In general, the system tray icon shows the current temperature. However, as
always, it's a little more complex than that! What the icon shows actually
depends on a number of factors.
<ul>
<li>The UK Weather options</li>
<li>The temperature</li>
<li>Whether the temperature or the description of the weather has changed</li>
<li>Whether there is an Internet connection when UK Weather tries to obtain data
</li>
<li>Whether the postcode entered is valid</li>
<li>What was previously displayed as the icon</li>
</ul>
The following table attempts to explain the algorithm used.<br><br>
<table>

<tr>
<td class="bold">Status</td>
<td class="bold">Resulting Icon</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>UK Weather has just been started and is attempting to obtain data.</td>
<td>A question mark:<br><br>
<div class="center"><img src="images\question-off.jpg"></div><br><br>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Weather data was sucessfully obtained.</td>
<td>A normal temperature icon.<br><br>
If the option "No Change" is chosen, then the icon will simply show the
temperature as and when it changes:<br>
<div class="center"><img src="images\icon-off.jpg"></div><br><br>
If the option "Change Once" is chosen, then the icon
will show the temperature in a lighter colour than normal:<br>
<div class="center"><img src="images\icon-on.jpg"></div>
Once the mouse is moved over the icon, it will revert back to the normal icon:
<div class="center"><img src="images\icon-off.jpg"></div>
This option is useful if you wish to be alerted to a change in the weather, but
find a flashing icon too distracting.<br><br><br>
If the options "Flash" or "Flash Continuously" are chosen, then the icon
will alternate between a lighter colour and the normal colour:<br>
<div class="center"><img src="images\icon-flash.jpg"></div>
Then, if the option "Flash" is chosen, once the mouse is moved over the icon
, it will revert back to the normal icon:
<div class="center"><img src="images\icon-off.jpg"></div><br><br>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>UK Weather has obtained data but the data doesn't contain a valid
temperature.</td>
<td>
The letter "X":<br>
<div class="center"><img src="images\odddata-off.jpg"> or 
<img src="images\odddata-on.jpg"></div><br><br>
The flashing behaviour of the icon is exactly the same as for a normal
temperature icon.<br><br>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>The returned data could not be parsed into something useful. This usually
occurs if the postcode is invalid.</td>
<td>
The letter "P":<br>
<div class="center"><img src="images\badpostcode-off.jpg"> or 
<img src="images\badpostcode-on.jpg"></div><br><br>
The flashing behaviour of the icon is exactly the same as for a normal
temperature icon.<br><br>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>The web site could not be contacted. This would normally happen if a
dial-up connection was being used and the connection was currently closed.</td>
<td>
This is the most complex situation!<br><br>
If the previous status was an invalid
postcode, the icon displayed is the letter "N". In addition, the error is logged
in the Event Log. This overrides all other possibilites:<br>
<div class="center"><img src="images\nonetwork-off.jpg"> or 
<img src="images\nonetwork-on.jpg"></div><br><br>
Otherwise, if the postcode has been changed since UK Weather lost connection
to the Internet (or UK weather has just been started), the icon displayed is
also the letter "N" and the error is logged in the Event Log:<br>
<div class="center"><img src="images\nonetwork-off.jpg"> or 
<img src="images\nonetwork-on.jpg"></div><br><br>
If the postcode is unchanged since the connection was lost, UK Weather continues
to display the last obtained weather:<br>
<div class="center"><img src="images\icon-off.jpg"> or 
<img src="images\icon-on.jpg"></div><br><br>
How do you know that the connection has been lost? The time that UK Weather last
tried to obtain data and the time that UK Weather last obtained data
successfully will be greater than the update frequency.<br><br>
The flashing behaviour of the icon is exactly the same as for a normal
temperature icon.<br><br>
