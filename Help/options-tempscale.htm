<h1>Options - Temperature Scale</h1>
Use the check boxes to select either degress Celsius (centigrade) or degrees
Farenheit. Note the following when changing the temperature scale.
<ol>
<li>The Temperature in Farenheit is calculated from the Celsius temperature
rather than obtained directly from the web site. Therefore, the temperature in
degrees Farenheit may be slightly different (by one degree sometimes) from the
temperature displayed on the web site. The technical reason is that the web site
actually does a series of redirections (4 at the time of writing) if Farenheit
is chosen. The redirections are based on cookies dropped onto the PC during the
redirections. UK Weather, however, is not written to parse cookies or indeed the
javascript code that does the redirection. Therefore, the simpler option to
obtain the raw data from the web site in degress Celsius and simply converting
it has been chosen instead.</li>
<li>If the temperature scale is changed, it will not show until the end of the
current update interval. Therefore, to see the change immediately, select "OK
and Update", or "Update Now" from the menu. (This behaviour may change in future
versions.)
