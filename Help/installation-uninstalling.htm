<h1>Uninstalling UK Weather</h1>
To uninstall UK Weather, it is best (by far) to use "Add or Remove Programs" in
the Control Panel. UK Weather appears as "UK Weather" in the list of
applications.<br><br>
Uninstallation removes all registry entries, including any startup settings and
the saved configuration settings.<br><br>
If you run into problems uninstalling, use the information in the
<a href="installation-details.htm">Installation Details</a> section to strip out
any settings manually.
