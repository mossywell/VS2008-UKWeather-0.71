<h1>Update Now</h1>
Select the "Update Now" menu option to force UK Weather to try to update the
data. UK Weather will behave exactly as if it were due to update the weather
data. Also, the timer is reset, when "Update Now" is chosen. For example, if
the update interval is every 10 minutes and the "Update Now" option is chosen
after 3 minutes, UK Weather will update immediately and then after 10 minutes,
not 7 minutes.
