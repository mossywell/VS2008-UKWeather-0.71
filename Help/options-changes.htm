<h1>Options - When Weather Changes</h1>
This option allows you to decide what happens to the icon when the weather
changes. Any one of the following events causes the weather to be seen as having
changed:
<ol>
<li>The postcode</li>
<li>The weather description</li>
<li>The temperature</li>
<li>The "feels like" temperature</li>
</ol>
The choices for what to do are as follows.<br><br>
<div class="center"><img src="images\options-changes.png"></div><br><br>

<table>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>Flash Continuously</td>
<td>The icon will flash continuously every second (or whatever frequency is
specified in the options) from light to dark. The flashing will NOT cease when
the mouse is moved over the icon.</td>
