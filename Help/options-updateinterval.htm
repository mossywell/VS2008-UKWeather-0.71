<h1>Options - Update Interval</h1>
Use the slide bar or the text box to input the frequency with which to try to
obtain fresh data. The value is in seconds. The minimum value is 30 seconds and
the maximum is 14400 seconds (4 hours). The input box accepts only numbers and
any value ouside of the maximum or minimum is changed to the nearest acceptable
value. For example, if 99999 is entered, UK Weather will change this to 14400.
Note that:
<ul>
<li>The data is only as up to date as the web site from which the data is
obtained!</li>
<li>The value entered is stored in the registry. If the registry value is
changed manually, UK Weather will ensure that the value falls within the maximum
and minimum values. If the registry value is missing, or contains garbage, UK
Weather defaults to 300 seconds.</li>
<li>Changes input via the interface are dynamic. That is, UK Weather does not
require a restart for the changes to take effect. Changes input via the
registry require a restart of UK Weather.</li>
</ul>
