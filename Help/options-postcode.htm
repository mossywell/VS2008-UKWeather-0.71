<h1>Options - Postcode</h1>
Enter the first part of the postcode in the postcode box. Up to 4 characters are
accepted. The postcode is not validated until UK Weather tries to obtain the
weather from the Internet. If the web site does not recognise the postcode, UK
Weather will display a "P". This will occur even if the postcode is valid, but
is not recognised (as sometimes happens with new postcodes). Note that:
<ul>
<li>The value entered is stored in the registry. If the registry value is
missing, UK Weather defaults to "SW19". If the registry value contains more than
4 characters, it is truncated to the first 4 characters.</li>
<li>Changes input via the interface are dynamic. That is, UK Weather does not
require a restart for the changes to take effect. Changes input via the
registry require a restart of UK Weather.</li>
</ul>
