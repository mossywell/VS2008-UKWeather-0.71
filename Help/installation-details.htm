<h1>Installation Details</h1>
This section explains what is installed and where. It is useful if you wish to
uninstall the software manually, for example.<br><br>
<a href="#Desktop_Changes">Desktop Changes</a><br>
<a href="#Installed_Files">Installed Files</a><br>
<a href="#Registry_Settings">Registry Settings</a>

<h2><a name="Desktop_Changes">Desktop Changes</a></h2>
The setup program only adds an icon to the desktop. The start menu is left
untouched. So, if you want to add the item to the start menu, you will have to
add it manually.

<h2><a name="Installed_Files">Installed Files</a></h2>
The default installation directory is:
<ul>
<li>C:\Program Files\Mossywell\UK Weather</li>
</ul>
As of version 0.60, the files installed into this directory are:<br><br>
<table>
<tr>
<td class="bold">File</td>
<td class="bold">Details</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>README.TXT</td>
<td>Last minute information about the application not present in the help
pages.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UKWeather.exe</td>
<td>The application itself. Note that it is a standalone executable and doesn't
come with any DLLs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>UKWeather.chm</td>
<td>This help file!</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2><a name="Registry_Settings">Registry Settings</a></h2>
As of version 0.50, the Class IDs used by this application are:
<ul>
<li>{05120F5A-9D53-4C7B-80D2-B307EFAAAB93} - used by the installer</li>
</ul>
Application settings are stored in the following location:
<ul>
<li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Mossywell\UK Weather</li>
</ul>
The individual values are obvious because they're taken directly from the
interface, so they won't be explained further here. Note that XML files are not
used to store settings (which is Microsoft's preferred method in .Net
applications) because XML settings are not dynamic and only take effect when
the application is restarted.<br><br>
If the "Run at system startup" option is chosen, it stores the setting in the
following location:
<ul>
<li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</li>
</ul>
in a value (not surprisingly) called "UKWeather". Note that I'm using the
current user rather than HKEY_LOCAL MACHINE hive.<br><br>
Finally, the Windows Installer saves a plethora of settings. They're not listed
here, but a trawl for the word "mossywell" in the registry will dig them out.
