<h1>Options - Check For New Version...</h1>
By default, UK Weather checks 3 things when it starts up:
<ol>
<li>Whether there is a new version of UK Weather available</li>
<li>Whether a different URL should be used for obtaining the data from the
Internet</li>
<li>Whether, <i>if</i> a new version of UK Weather is found, the user should be
notified and given the option to download the new version.</li>
</ol>
The "Check for new version and URL" check box allows you to decide whether or
not you want UK Weather to check for a new version and to check if the URL that
data is obtained from has changed. Note that both of these pieces of information
are obtained from the same source, so they cannot be separated out. If this 
option is checked, the following will be seen as UK Weather starts:<br><br>
<div class="center"><img src="images/form-status.png"></div><br><br>
It is recommened that this option be left ticked as the URL option is
particularly useful.
