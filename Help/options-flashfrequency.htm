<h1>Options - Icon Flash Frequency</h1>
Use the slide bar or the text box to input the frequency with which the system
tray icon flashes (when the conditions are such as to cause it to flash). The
value is in milliseconds. The minimum value is 100 milliseconds and
the maximum is 5000 milliseconds. The input box accepts only numbers and
any value ouside of the maximum or minimum is changed to the nearest acceptable
value. For example, if 9999 is entered, UK Weather will change this to 5000.
Note that:
<ul>
<li>Technically, the value is actually half the frequency, as the value entered
is the duration that the icon stays a particular colour for. Of course,
mathematically speaking, the frequency should include a whole cycle and not half
a cycle!</li>
<li>The value entered is stored in the registry. If the registry value is
changed manually, UK Weather will ensure that the value falls within the maximum
and minimum values. If the registry value is missing, or contains garbage, UK
Weather defaults to 500 milliseconds.</li>
<li>Changes input via the interface are dynamic. That is, UK Weather does not
require a restart for the changes to take effect. Changes input via the
registry require a restart of UK Weather.</li>
</ul>
