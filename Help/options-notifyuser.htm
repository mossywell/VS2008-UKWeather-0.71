<h1>Options - Notify User...</h1>
By default, UK Weather checks 3 things when it starts up:
<ol>
<li>Whether there is a new version of UK Weather available</li>
<li>Whether a different URL should be used for obtaining the data from the
Internet</li>
<li>Whether, <i>if</i> a new version of UK Weather is found, the user should be
notified and given the option to download the new version.</li>
</ol>
The "Notify user if new version is found" check box allows you to decide whether
or not you want to be notified in the event that a new version is found. If a
new version is found and there is a tick in this box, the following popup will
appear:<br><br>
<div class="center"><img src="images/options-newverpopup.png"></div><br><br>
Of course, the numbers will be different. Checking the "Don't ask me again"
box, followed by either of the two buttons, has the same effect as unchecking
the "Notify user if new version is found" check box. From here, there are two
options.
<ol>
<li>Download = Go to the web page that has the new version. Note that as of
version 0.6, the software is not automatically downloaded or installed (though
this may be a feature of a later version).</li>
<li>Ignore = Ingore the warning and continue as normal.</li>
</ol>
